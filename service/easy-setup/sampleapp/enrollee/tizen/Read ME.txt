********* Steps to build and run tizen enrollee sample**********

1.Build iotitvity for tizen: 
	sh gbsbuild.sh
	
2. Install tizen Ide-2.3.0 or 2.3.1

3. Download and extract the boost library 

4. Import EnrolleeSample from "service\easysetup\sampleapp\tizen\"  ”.(Do not copy it into tizen workspace)
(make sure you have a full copy of iotivity)

5. Adding  Libraries:
5.1 the following libs are required:
•	liboc.so
•	liboctbstack.so
•	libconnectivity_abstraction.so
•	liboc_logger.so
•	liboc_logger_core.so
•	libESSDKLibrary.so
****** and support libs****
•	libboost_date_time.so
•	libboost_system.so
•	libboost_thread.so
•	libuuid.so

5.2 how to get the first 6 libs:
	1. Go the <user-home>/GBS-ROOT/local/repos/tizen/armv7l/RPMS/
	2. copy iotivity-0.9.2-0.armv7l.rpm & iotivity-service-0.9.2-0.armv7l.rpm (these will be generated if step-1 is successfull)
	3. Extract twice(first rpm and then cpio file) using 7-zip
	4. this will generate a "usr/lib" folder
	5. copy required libs to the lib folder to enrollee sample tizen project

5.3 the last four libs(boost and uuid) can be found at the following path:
	<user-home>/GBS-ROOT/local/BUILD-ROOTS/scratch.armv7l.0/usr/lib
	
6. adding boost path:
	go to "EnrolleeSample->properties->C/C++ build->C++ compiler->Includes" and the path to the boost library(from step3)
